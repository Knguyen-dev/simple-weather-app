- Todo list priorities:
	- It seems like we've successfully figured out the issue and now we've 
	separated the code properly. Now the rendering code is in 'rendering.js'.

	1. Take a second to re-comment the code in rendering.js

	2. Then finally work on the light theme and functionality for toggling 
		light theme.
